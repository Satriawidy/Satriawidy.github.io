    <h1> Personal Website</h1>
    <p> My name is Satria Widyanto and I am an aspiring 
        theoretical physicist.</p>
    <p> I obtained my MSc degree in theoretical physics 
        from the University of Edinburgh. I did a dissertation project on 
        "<i>Feasibility Study to Search for Higgs Boson Decays to Gluons Using Machine 
            Learning at the LHC</i>", where I analysed the simulated events related to
            $H \rightarrow gg$ process and study the feasibility of observing the process
            in the upcoming high-luminosity (HL) phase of the LHC. During the analysis,
            I used several machine learning frameworks, such as graph neural networks 
            and boosted decision trees. </p>
    <p> I am passionate about teaching and have strong 
        interest in using computer program for solving physics problem. During my undergraduate
        degree, I worked as teaching assistant for several courses, including mechanics, 
        statistical physics, and introduction to particle physics. Recently, aside from
        applying machine learning during the dissertation project, I have also worked on
        several small projects, such as using differential equation solver for studying
        the early evolution of the universe, and studying the simple implementation of lattice
        QCD.
